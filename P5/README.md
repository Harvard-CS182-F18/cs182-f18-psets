## Written Assignment (25 points) 

As usual please go to the PDF in the written folder for the written instructions.

Question 1 (4 points)

Question 2 (6 points)

Question 3 (7 points)

Question 4 (8 points)

## Computational Assignment (15 points)

**Note: you need numpy and matplotlib for these problems but should already have this installed from Simulated Annealing. If not please run: `pip install numpy matplotlib`**

### K-Means (6 points)
In this assignment, you will implement a K-Means clustering algorithm.  All of the instructions you need should be in the code/kmeans/kmeans.py file. To visualize your implementation, simply run:

``python kmeans.py``

### Naive Bayes (9 points)
In this assignment, you will implement a Naive Bayes classifier to predict the number of stars given to a movie based on text from its review. In the code/naiveBayes folder is a python file titled hw5.py which contains all instructions for the problems. To run your implementation agains the mini data locally, simply run:

``python naiveBayes.py``

Note: this autograder will take about 3 minutes to run so be patient.
